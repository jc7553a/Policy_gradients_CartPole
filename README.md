# Policy_gradients_CartPole
Policy Gradient Learning with CartPole-v0

## Getting started
The challenge of the week was: <b>solving a simple game using policy gradients (other than pong).</b>
I've chosen CartPole v1.0 because that's a basic game and there is a ton of documentations/tutorials about that kind of game. 

### Goal 
CartPole-v0 defines "solving" as <b>getting average reward of 195.0 over 100 consecutive trials. </b>


### Dependencies
<ul>
  <li>numpy</li>
  <li>gym <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym"> https://github.com/openai/gym </a></li>
  <li> tensorflow </li>
</ul>

### Usage
<p> To be more readable and more easier to explain the code I use Jupyter Notebook  </p> 
<p> Run jupyter notebook in terminal and run all the cells </p>
